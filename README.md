# Javascript Quiz
A timer multiple choice quiz made using Javascript

# Description

* On opening the page, the user will be shown a screen with rules and a start button and a "thank you" at the bottom of the first page. 

* Upon clicking the start button, the screen will show the first of 5 multiple choice questions and the timer will start counting down from 45 seconds. 

* For each question, if the user clicks the correct answer, their score will show as 'correct answer!" and will display below the quiz. If the incorrect answer is clicked, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer and "wrong answer!" will display below the quiz. 

* Once the timer ends or all the questions have been displayed, the screen will display the "Game over" message together with the user's final score and an input field to input initials. 

* After putting in initials and the submit clicked then the user will then be sent to a High Scores page that will display the high scores with the initials. The user will also be presented with two buttons, one to restart the quiz and the other one to reset the high score and remove it from local storage.
